Ultimately, the purpose of a README is to instruct the user as to what the application does, how it is compiled and installed and how the application is used. A user should be able to build, run and use your application with minimal effort. If the user encounters an issue, they should be able to get support, therefore you should include some instructions for troubleshooting and a way to contact you in case that fails. Note that it is good practice, although it is not required, that you do not commit directly to a master branch, instead pull from a working branch when changes are considered final.

Other features that contribute to a great README file may include:

     A project logo
     Project badges
     Demo screenshots / gifs
     Table of contents
     Concise project description
     Clear install instructions
     Features list
     Links to further reading
     Change log

There are a number of guides and templates for working with README files in awesome-readme. Have a read of some of those and find a style that works best for you and your project.
