## Project description
This project is a React Native application for viewing artwork and information from the Art Institute of Chicago's public API. The AIC API is a REST-style API that provides data of tonnes of information regarding the Arts Institute of Chicago. For the purposes of this project, I will only be looking at the artwork. https://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/.  Information about the API can be found here https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction.

Ultimately, the purpose of a README is to instruct the user as to what the application does, how it is compiled and installed and how the application is used. A user should be able to build, run and use your application with minimal effort. If the user encounters an issue, they should be able to get support, therefore you should include some instructions for troubleshooting and a way to contact you in case that fails. Note that it is good practice, although it is not required, that you do not commit directly to a master branch, instead pull from a working branch when changes are considered final.

Other features that contribute to a great README file may include:

     A project logo
     Project badges
     Demo screenshots / gifs
