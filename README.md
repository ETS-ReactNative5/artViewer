Project Documentation:

Half of your project mark (20% over-all) is based on the documentation in your github README file.

A README is a form of documentation that contains information about the project contained within a repository.

The README file typically includes:

     Configuration instructions
     Installation instructions
     Operating instructions
     A manifest (list of files)
     Copyright information
     Contact information
     Bug list
     Troubleshooting tips
     Credits and acknowledgments

A README file is arguably the most important part of an open-source software project. Writing an effective README is, unfortunately, more art than science.

The best way to learn the art of README writing is through practice. You should practice both reading and writing good README files. Matias Singers maintains a curated list of repositories with well written README files: github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme

Ultimately, the purpose of a README is to instruct the user as to what the application does, how it is compiled and installed and how the application is used. A user should be able to build, run and use your application with minimal effort. If the user encounters an issue, they should be able to get support, therefore you should include some instructions for troubleshooting and a way to contact you in case that fails. Note that it is good practice, although it is not required, that you do not commit directly to a master branch, instead pull from a working branch when changes are considered final.

Other features that contribute to a great README file may include:

     A project logo
     Project badges
     Demo screenshots / gifs
     Table of contents
     Concise project description
     Clear install instructions
     Features list
     Links to further reading
     Change log

There are a number of guides and templates for working with README files in awesome-readme. Have a read of some of those and find a style that works best for you and your project.
